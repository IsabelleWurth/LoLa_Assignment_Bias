# Measuring Bias in NLI Datasets

The code and data in this repository is introduced in our paper which aims to measure different kinds of bias in several NLI datasets. We created models that evaluate the amount of Negation-bias, Word-overlap bias, Hypothesis-only bias and Premise-only bias. The train and test datasets and models that we used can be found in this repository. The majority baseline model was used to compare the accuracy of the models on each dataset. The majority_baseline model can also be found in this repository.
